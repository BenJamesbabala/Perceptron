# Perceptron
A flexible artificial neural network builder for, to analysis performance, and optimise the best model. 

Perceptron is a software that will help researchers, students, and programmers to
design, compare, and test artificial neural networks. As it stands, there are few visual
tools that do this for free, and with simplicity.
This software will largely be for educational purposes, allowing people to experiment
and understand how the different attributes within an ANN can result in
different performances and better results.
